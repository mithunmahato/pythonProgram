Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    records=[]
    scorelist=[]
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        records+=[[name,score]]
        scorelist+=[score]
    b=sorted(list(set(scorelist)))[1]
    for a,c in sorted(records):
        if c==b:
            print(a)
